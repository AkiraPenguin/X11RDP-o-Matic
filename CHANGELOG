CHANGELOG
=========

--= v3.0-BETA1 =--
[X11rdp-o-Matic]
------------------------

. changed the git download to the main repository
. removed the writing of an edited xrdp.ini configuration file - the "modern" version supplied upstream has x11rdp as default
  and also has additional options configured
. added checkinstall to create an xrdp package for handling by a distro's package manager
. Use the Xorg 7.6 build script as supplied with the xrdp tree (Hurrah!)
. Updated the editing of buildx.sh by using a patch, instead of editing it directly via sed
. The patch file will be edited instead then used to patch buildx.sh
. Patched buildx.sh will use checkinstall to build the Xorg packages (Hurrah!)
. Added update-rc.d command so that xrdp will start on next boot
. All created packages and the X11rdp binary copied into a final packages dir for easy copying and transfer to
  another system for installation - now you can compile on just one system and install on another without
  compiling on the other system ;)
. Patches xrdp Makefile in order to generate a package
. Patches X11rdp Makefile in order to generate a package
. Removed Zenity front-end entirely! The text/dialog front-end for rdp-o-matic is good enough. Less to maintain, too.
. cleaned up the script to remove cruft from previous versions
. Changed CHANGELOG order to "latest to earliest" ;)

[RDPsesconfig]
-------------------------
. Included MATE for various versions of Ubuntu - will automatically add the repository according to which Ubuntu version.
. Removed Zenity front-end entirely! The text front-end is good enough. Zenity was a pain and it means less to maintain.
. cleaned up the script somewhat to remove some cruft

.....ooOOOOOoo.....

v2.5
X11rdp-o-Matic
------------------------
. dpkg-status response has changed in Debian Wheezy! Changed the package status test to reflect this, which will also work with older distros.

v2.4
. set LANG so that dpkg etc. return the expected responses so the script is guaranteed to work under different locales

v2.3
. now works and tested with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

v2.2
RDPsesconfig
-----------------------
. fixed naive grepping for username in /etc/passwd.

V2.1
X11rdp-o-Matic
-------------------------
. corrected error in package status test condition on line 166 - thanks to Daniel for pointing it out ;)

v2.0
X11rdp-o-Matic
-------------------------
. Added package repository update before checking for required packages
. Modularized for multiple dialog front-ends
. Added a text dialog front-end
. Added a check for running on a non-X display terminal (will revert to text-only if so)
. Uses the text mode front-end by default - Zenity is limited and rubbish!
. Added command line parameters: --justdoit , --nocpuoptimze , --zenityfrontend , --keepsource , --nocleanup
. Now runs in a text only environment - suitable for "Server" distro variants with no Xorg installed as yet, or
  basically for anyone who prefers the text interface over the Zenity one.
. Added a non-interactive, "just do it" mode so script will run from start to end, with "sane" defaults
. Really tidied up the script, should make it easier to read and edit later
. Source code is downloaded to inside wherever the ScaryMatic directory is located
. Added alteration of xrdp source code Makefile.am so the PID file is now in /var/run/xrdp/
. Changed "PIDDIR=/var/run/" to "PIDDIR=/var/run/xrdp/" in the xrdp init script

. Added command line parameter: --zenityfrontend
. Really tidied up the script, should make it easier to read and edit later
. Removed the experimental PolicyKit rules generator. System admins should consider implementing their policies carefully.
